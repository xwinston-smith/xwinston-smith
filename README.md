> *Letting go is Peace, Happiness is Slavery, Mindfulness is Strength.*

I hope everyday I wake up to make the world better. Even a bit — but it worth to try. As an ordinary one who has nothing significant and special. Waking up in the morning and contemplating how can I improve our lifes and human society; Thinking about real world problems and integrate my knowledge and my imagination in a new way and doing something everyday is make my life able to move further. Even I failed a thousand times; Even I never make any change but it's still enough to make my life meaningful. Life is mysterious full of questions with no answer. I would not find the meaning or anything because finally I would find out that actually there's nothing — **Nothing**. I simply need to live follow by my instinct because it's the only thing that know everything.

Hi, my name is Simon — *Simon Isara*. I am interested in *social science*, *psychology*, *behavioral science*, and *computer technology*. I love mixing my knowledge and imagination in new ways to create something cool. I am fascinated by *The Dynamics of Nature*, whether it's *social dynamics* or *economic dynamics*, as it holds the power to change the entire planet with a simple trigger. By integrating technology and an understanding of *The Dynamics of Nature*, it becomes even more powerful than I can imagine, and make me question, " What can I do with it? " I love contemplating, daydreaming, and observing everything around me, questioning " How could it be like that? " and connecting things randomly.

Anything that brings you here is a fortune. And I hope one day we will see each other in a better world.
